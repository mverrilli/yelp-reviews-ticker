# yelp-reviews-ticker

This is fixed to work with Yelp API 2.0, however they gimped the API to only return a single review making this plugin much less interesting.  In any case, should Yelp be nice enough to open the reviews up again, this plugin should work.

Pretty disappointing, especially since I didn't realize this until after I made all the changes.
